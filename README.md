Welcome to the repository of my Marvel character selection project!
About the Project
This project consists of a web page that simulates the character selection screen for a Marvel game. I used HTML, CSS, and JS to build it and make it more interactive. Additionally, I used different CSS styling techniques to create an attractive and responsive interface.

Features
Users can select their favorite characters;
The interface is responsive and can be used on different devices.
